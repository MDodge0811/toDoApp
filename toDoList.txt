User should input their reminder into the text box and hit ‘submit’,

‘Submit’ stores their response in a JSON file.

To get a JSON file, I need to store the input as a javascript object, then convert that object to JSON.

JSON = [
    user : {
	reminders: [
    {
		reminder: “remind me of something”,
		id: “isgoidafjk”
		},
  ]
	cookie: “919827592”
	}

We will generate a cookie and store that in the JSON object as well. 

Then the website will check the cookies of the user a populate the appropriate list of reminders. 

Each time the user does anything, we need to make sure we operate on the correct list of to-do’s.

reminder: 
<div> 
<textbox>"Reminder text"</textbox>
<button> Check </button>
<button> Remove </button>
</div>
